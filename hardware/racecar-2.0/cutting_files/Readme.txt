This set of DXF files contains:



00_RACECAR 12x24 Cutting File.DXF   - Cuts two copies of B1 and B2.



01_RACECAR 12x24 Cutting File.DXF
	thru
06_RACECAR 12x24 Cutting File.DXF   - All of these cut 3 copies of B3.
				      Each one has a different set of
                                      3 car numbers.



All files were made to work with 12x24 sheets of ABS. Note that it is
recommended to construct part B2 out of aluminum instead of ABS to
assist with cooling the laser scanner.
